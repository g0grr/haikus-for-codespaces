Modulation  
Amplitude modulated (AM):
Radio stations modulate the height of the carrier signal .
____________
Frequency modulate (FM):
Radio stations modulate the frequency of the carrier signal is determined by the electrical signal by the microphone .
_________
Phase modulation :
In WLANs is used to superimpose the data signal into the Carrier that is broadcast by the transmitter .

Transmission Direction :
Simple transmission: signal may travel in one direction . 

Half duplex transmission: signals may travel in both directions over a medium.
 - Only one direction at a time.

Full duplex: signals free to travel in both directions over a medium simultaneously.
- Used on data network . 
——————-
Transmission directions Multiplexing : 
Multiplex: transmission from allowing multiple signals to travel simultaneously over one medium .

Multiplexer (mux) :combines multiple signals .
- sending end of channel 

Demultiplexer (demux) : separate combined signals and regenerates them in original from.
-Receiving end of channel .

Attenuation:
Means a loss of energy .
When a signal travel through a medium it loses some 
Note : attenuation —-> due to resistance
